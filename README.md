# For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.

# Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
# score = playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
  #  //console.log(score)
   # //if playRound()  
#     # //computerSelection = getComputerChoice()
#    //playerSelection = prompt().toLowerCase();
#     //score = score + playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
#    //console.log(score)
