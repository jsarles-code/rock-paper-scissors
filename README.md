# begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 

# Use prompt() to get input from the user. Read the docs here if you need to.

# Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"

# Make your function’s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).

# Important note: you want to return the results of this function call, not console.log() them.

# Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.

# Loop or  Just call your playRound function 5 times in a row. 

# At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
