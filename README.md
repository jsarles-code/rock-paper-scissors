# Create three buttons, one for each(r,p,s) selection.
# Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked.
# (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
# Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
# Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
# You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life.

# score = playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
  #  //console.log(score)
   # //if playRound()  
#     # //computerSelection = getComputerChoice()
#    //playerSelection = prompt().toLowerCase();
#     //score = score + playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
#    //console.log(score)

# Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for this step)
